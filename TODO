I need to close down all other programs that can use the GPU when I run Twig -- they can cause Out Of Memory errors because Torch does not allocate enough memory at the start. That in turn happens since other programs are using GPU memory.
- Is there a way I can prevent other programs from using the GPU at all?

Random seed and checkpointing -- this could hurt reproducibility to checkpoint-restored results

So, in my results, Spearman correlation is 1 but Pearson is 0. This seems to tell me that something is quite wrong...but I am not sure why. 

I can integrate CensNet here; for ex, for a graph classifier, I could add its class definition as a model and then use it in GraphClf to integrate the two, I think
