Verify that my epoch hops have high correlation
I need to close down all other programs that can use the GPU when I run Twig -- they can cause Out Of Memory errors because Torch does not allocate enough memory at the start. That in turn happens since other programs are using GPU memory.
- Is there a way I can prevent other programs from using the GPU at all?
